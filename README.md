# Chat-app-SASS-illustration-
This project is a personal exploration of mine to create a minimalist chat interface using HTML and Sass. The goal of this project was to challenge myself to create a clean and modern design that was both responsive and easy to use.

### Knowledge Used
In this project, I utilized various Sass features to enhance the readability and maintainability of the code. These included:

- Partials: Breaking up the Sass code into partial files for easy management and organization.
- Mixins: Creating reusable blocks of code that can be included multiple times with different values.
- Nesting: Writing nested selectors to indicate the structure of the HTML and make the code more intuitive.
- At-rules: Using at-rules like @import and @media to import other files and define media queries.
By utilizing these Sass features, I was able to write more efficient and scalable code for this project.
